the term originated in the middle ages and first described a preparatory drawing for a piece of art such as a painting fresco tapestry or stained glass window in the 19th century it came to refer to humorous illustrations in magazines and newspapers and in the early 20th century and onward it referred to comic strips and animated films and television programs
fine art
a cartoon from the italian cartone and dutch word karton meaning strong heavy paper or pasteboard is a full size drawing made on sturdy paper as a study or modello for a painting stained glass or tapestry cartoons were typically used in the production of frescoes to accurately link the component parts of the composition when painted on damp plaster over a series of days giornate
such cartoons often have pinpricks along the outlines of the design  a bag of soot was then patted or pounced over the cartoon held against the wall to leave black dots on the plaster pouncing cartoons by painters such as the raphael cartoons in london and examples by leonardo da vinci are highly prized in their own right tapestry cartoons usually coloured were followed by eye by the weavers on the loom2
print media

caricature
a caricature is a portrait that exaggerates or distorts the essence of a person or thing to create an easily identifiable visual likeness in literature a caricature is a description of a person using exaggeration of some characteristics and oversimplification of others1
caricatures can be insulting or complimentary and can serve a political purpose or be drawn solely for entertainment caricatures of politicians are commonly used in editorial cartoons while caricatures of movie stars are often found in entertainment magazines
the term is derived from the italian caricare  to charge or load an early definition occurs in the english doctor thomas browne christian morals published posthumously in 1716
expose not thy self by four footed manners unto monstrous draughts and caricatura representations
with the footnote  
when men faces are drawn with resemblance to some other animals the italians call it to be drawn in caricatura
thus the word caricature essentially means a loaded portrait according to caricature teacher sam viviano the term refers only to depictions of real life people and not to cartoon fabrications of fictional characters which do not possess objective sets of physiognomic features to draw upon for reference or to anthropomorphic depictions of inanimate objects such as automobiles or coffee mugs legendary animator walt disney on the other hand equated his animation to caricature saying the hardest thing to do was find the caricature of an animal that worked best as a human like character
history
some of the earliest caricatures are found in the works of leonardo da vinci who actively sought people with deformities to use as models
the point was to offer an impression of the original which was more striking than a portrait diodemmar casem one of the great early practitioners was favored by the members of the papal court for his ability to depict the essence of a person in three or four strokescitation needed in fact the word caricature comes from the italian caricare to load thus the caricaturist aim is to invest his image with as much meaning as possible
caricature therefore experienced its first successes in the closed aristocratic circles of france and italy where such portraits could be passed about for mutual enjoyment
while the first book on caricature drawing to be published in england was mary darly a book of caricaturas c 1762 the first known north american caricatures were drawn in 1759 during the battle for quebec3 these caricatures were the work of brig gen george townshend whose caricatures of british general james wolfe depicted as deformed and crass and hideous snell4 were drawn to amuse fellow officers3 elsewhere two great practitioners of the art of caricature in 18th century britain were thomas rowlandson 17561827 and james gillray 17571815 rowlandson was more of an artist and his work took its inspiration mostly from the public at large gillray was more concerned with the vicious visual satirisation of political life they were however great friends and caroused together in the pubs of london see the tate gallery exhibit james gillray the art of caricature
in a lecture titled the history and art of caricature september 2007 queen mary 2 lecture theatre the british caricaturist ted harrison said that the caricaturist can choose to either mock or wound the subject with an effective caricature drawing caricatures can simply be a form of entertainment and amusement  in which case gentle mockery is in order  or the art can be employed to make a serious social or political point a caricaturist draws on 1 the natural characteristics of the subject the big ears long nose etc  2 the acquired characteristics stoop scars facial lines etc  and 3 the vanities choice of hair style spectacles clothes expressions and mannerisms

computerized caricature

there have been efforts to produce caricatures automatically or semi automatically using computer graphics techniques for example a system proposed by akleman et al6 provides warping tools specifically designed toward rapidly producing caricatures there are very few software programs designed specifically for automatically creating caricatures
computer graphic systems by necessity require quite different skillsets to caricatures created on paper thus using a computer in the digital production of caricatures requires advanced knowledge of the program functionality rather than being a simpler method of caricature creation it can be a more complex method of creating images that feature finer coloring textures than can be created using more traditional methods
a milestone in formally defining caricature was susan brennan master thesis7 in 1982 in her system caricature was formalized as the process of exaggerating differences from an average face for example if prince charles has more prominent ears than the average person in his caricature the ears will be much larger than normal brennan system implemented this idea in a partially automated fashion as follows the operator was required to input a frontal drawing of the desired person having a standardized topology the number and ordering of lines for every face she obtained a corresponding drawing of an average male face then the particular face was caricatured simply by subtracting from the particular face the corresponding point on the mean face the origin being placed in the middle of the face scaling this difference by a factor larger than one and adding the scaled difference back on to the mean face
though brennan formalization was introduced in the 1980s it remains relevant in recent work mo et al8 refined the idea by noting that the population variance of the feature should be taken into account for example the distance between the eyes varies less than other features such as the size of the nose thus even a small variation in the eye spacing is unusual and should be exaggerated whereas a correspondingly small change in the nose size relative to the mean would not be unusual enough to be worthy of exaggeration
on the other hand liang et al9 argue that caricature varies depending on the artist and cannot be captured in a single definition their system uses machine learning techniques to automatically learn and mimic the style of a particular caricature artist given training data in the form of a number of face photographs and the corresponding caricatures by that artist the results produced by computer graphic systems are arguably not yet of the same quality as those produced by human artists for example most systems are restricted to exactly frontal poses whereas many or even most manually produced caricatures and face portraits in general choose an off center three quarters view brennan caricature drawings were frontal pose line drawings more recent systems can produce caricatures in a variety of styles including direct geometric distortion of photographs
the science of caricature

leopold et al10 found that individual face recognizing neurons in the inferotemporal cortex respond more strongly to caricatured faces than to the veridical representations of the same face and suggest that the visual brain may code faces relative to a prototypical face consistent with brennan formalization
ramachandran and hirstein11 suggested that caricature is related to peak shift in the peak shift effect animals sometimes respond more strongly to exaggerated versions of the training stimuli for example if a rat is trained to respond to a rectangle of a particular aspect ratio and to avoid a square when later presented with several rectangles it will prefer the one with the most elongated aspect ratio this being the one that is most different from the square rather than the original rectangle used in training ramachandran and hirstein speculated that cells in a monkey brain that respond to particular faces would respond more strongly to caricatured versions of the face this effect has been confirmed in fmri experiments by tsao11
modern use of caricature
beside the political and public figure satire most contemporary caricatures are used as gifts or souvenirs often drawn by street vendors for a small fee a caricature can be drawn specifically and quickly for a patron these are popular at street fairs carnivals and even weddings often with humorous results12
caricature artists are also popular attractions at many places frequented by tourists especially oceanfront boardwalks where vacationers can have a humorous caricature sketched in a few minutes for a small fee caricature artists can be a great interactive form of entertainment for parties where they will draw caricatures of the guests for their entertainment

persona
from wikipedia the free ency
a persona in the word everyday usage is a social role or a character played by an actor the word is derived from latin where it originally referred to a theatrical mask the latin word probably derived from the etruscan word phersu with the same meaning and that from the greek prosopon its meaning in the latter roman period changed to indicate a character of a theatrical performance

in literature

in literature the term has become associated with the work of two modern poets ezra pound and ts eliot they understood the term slightly differently and derived its use and meaning from different traditions eliot had taken over and developed laforgue ironic i whereas pound worked from robert browning dramatic monologues eliot personae were prufrock and sweeney pound were cino bertran de born propertius and mauberley whereas eliot used masks to distance himself from aspects of modern life which he found degrading and repulsive pound personae were poets and could be considered in good part alter egos who are to be dissociated from characters like malatesta john adams confucius or thomas jefferson that we find in pound later poetry the cantos for pound the personae were a way of working through a specific poetic problem in this sense the persona is a transparent mask wearing the traits of two poets and responding to two situations old and new which are similar and overlapping in homage to sextus propertius for example pound translated parts of propertius elegies and by means of various modernisations of diction drew attention to parallelisms existing between propertius situation and pound own especially the pressures of living in an empire at war and pound need to cease writing shorter lyrical poems and start on longer epic structures pound at that time 1917 had written his first three cantos but was doubtful of their value in writing the homage he worked through his anxieties of whether the epic was compatible with modernity or worth writing at all given the political and social statement of the genre pound at that time had no political education which he would start to acquire only after the end of wwi with ch douglas and ar orage in the offices of the new age
in music
usually the performers assume a role that matches the music they sing on stage though they may also be composers for that reason many performers make use of a persona some artists create various characters specially if their career is long and go through many changes over time that is the case for example of david bowie initially largely recognizable as the alien ziggy stardust and later as the thin white duke1 more than just artistic pseudonyms they are independent characters used in the artist shows and albums in the case the rise and fall of ziggy stardust and the spiders from mars and station to station however in music a persona does not always mean a change some authors for instance has noted that bob dylan charisma is accredited largely to his almost stereotyped image always with a harmonica guitar and with his distinctive hair voice and clothing2 the persona also serves to claim a right or to draw attention to a certain subject that is the case of marilyn manson and his interest on death and morbidity and madonna and her interest on sexuality3
the concept of persona in music was introduced by edward t cone in his the composer voice 1974 that dealt with the relation between the lyrical self of a song lyrics and its composer4 nowadays the concept of persona can be used to refer also to an instrumentalist like a pianist and his playing style5 although the term is more commonly used to refer to the voice and performance nuances of a vocalist in a studio album or in a live concert such as in the cases of maria bethânia elis regina edith piaf nina simone and also mick jagger of the rolling stones who takes the guise of satan in the song sympathy for the devil and of a housewife in slave etc it also remarkable in the case of sgt pepper lonely hearts club band by the beatles which presents a group persona6 specially the character billy shears played by drummer ringo starr7

physiognomy
physiognomy from the gk physis meaning nature and gnomon meaning judge or interpreter is the assessment of a person character or personality from their outer appearance especially the face the term physiognomy can also refer to the general appearance of a person object or terrain without reference to its implied characteristics
the credence of such study has varied from time to time the practice was well accepted by the ancient greek philosophers but fell into disrepute in the middle ages when practiced by vagabonds and mountebanks it was then revived and popularised by johann kaspar lavater before falling from favour again in the 20th century
it is now being revived again as some new research suggests that people faces might indicate such traits as trustworthiness social dominance and aggression the latter trait seems to be determined by the level of the hormone testosterone during puberty which affects the ratio between the height and width of the face   aggressive individuals are found to have wider faces1
physiognomy is also sometimes referred to as anthroposcopy though that was more common back in the 19th century whence the word anthroposcopy originated
ancient physiognomy

for more details on this topic see physiognomonics ancient physiognomy before the physiognomonics
notions of the relationship between an individual outward appearance and inner character are historically ancient and occasionally appear in early greek poetry the first indications of a developed physiognomic theory appear in 5th century athens where one zopyrus who featured in a dialogue by phaedo of elis was said to be expert in the art by the 4th century the philosopher aristotle makes frequent reference to theory and literature concerning the relationship of appearance to character aristotle was apparently receptive to such an idea as evidenced by a passage in his prior analytics 227
it is possible to infer character from features if it is granted that the body and the soul are changed together by the natural affections i say natural for though perhaps by learning music a man has made some change in his soul this is not one of those affections natural to us  rather i refer to passions and desires when i speak of natural emotions if then this were granted and also that for each change there is a corresponding sign and we could state the affection and sign proper to each kind of animal we shall be able to infer character from features
  trans a j jenkinson
the first systematic physiognomic treatise to survive to the present day is a slim volume physiognomonica english physiognomonics ascribed to aristotle but probably of his school rather than created by the philosopher himself the volume is divided into two parts conjectured to have been originally two separate works the first section discusses arguments drawn from nature or other races and concentrates on the concept of human behavior the second section focuses on animal behavior dividing the animal kingdom into male and female types from these are deduced correspondences between human form and character
after aristotle the major extant works in physiognomy are
polemo of laodicea de physiognomonia 2nd century ad in greek
adamantius the sophist physiognomonica 4th century in greek
an anonymous latin author de phsiognomonia ca 4th century
ancient greek mathematician astronomer and scientist pythagoras believed by some to be the originator of physiognomics once rejected a prospective follower named cylon simply because of his appearance which pythagoras deemed indicative of bad character3
middle ages
the term was common in middle english often written as fisnamy or visnomy as in the tale of beryn a 15th century sequel to the canterbury tales i knowe wele by thy fisnamy thy kynd it were to stele
physiognomy validity was once widely accepted and it was taught in universities until the time of henry viii of england who outlawed it along with palmestrye in 15314 around this time scholastic leaders settled on the more erudite greek form physiognomy and began to discourage the whole concept of fisnamy
modern physiognomy
the principal promoter of physiognomy in modern times was the swiss pastor johann kaspar lavater 17411801 who was briefly a friend of goethe lavater essays on physiognomy were first published in german in 1772 and gained great popularity these influential essays were translated into french and english the two principal sources from which lavater found confirmation of his ideas were the writings of the italian giambattista della porta 15351615 and the english physician philosopher sir thomas browne 16051682 whose religio medici discusses the possibility of the discernment of inner qualities from the outer appearance of the face thus
there is surely a physiognomy which those experienced and master mendicants observe for there are mystically in our faces certain characters that carry in them the motto of our souls wherein he that cannot read abc may read our natures
  rm part 22
late in his life browne affirmed his physiognomical beliefs writing in his christian morals circa 1675
since the brow speaks often true since eyes and noses have tongues and the countenance proclaims the heart and inclinations  let observation so far instruct thee in physiognomical lineswe often observe that men do most act those creatures whose constitution parts and complexion do most predominate in their mixtures this is a corner stone in physiognomy there are therefore provincial faces national lips and noses which testify not only the natures of those countries but of those which have them elsewhere
  cm part 2 section 9
sir thomas browne is also credited with the first usage of the word caricature in the english language whence much of physiognomy movement pseudo learning attempted to entrench itself by illustrative means
browne possessed several of the writings of the italian giambattista della porta including his of celestial physiognomy which argued that it was not the stars but a person temperament that influences facial appearance and character in his book de humana physiognomia 1586 porta used woodcuts of animals to illustrate human characteristics his works are well represented in the library of sir thomas browne  both men sustained a belief in the doctrine of signatures   that is the belief that the physical structures of nature such as a plant roots stem and flower were indicative keys or signatures to their medicinal potentials
the great inventor scientist and artist leonardo da vinci was a critic of physiognomy in the early 16th century he said i do not concern myself with false physiognomythere is no truth in them and this can be proven because these chimeras have no scientific foundation5 he did however believe that lines caused by facial expressions could indicate personality traits ie those who have deep and noticeable lines between the eyebrows are irascible6
the popularity of physiognomy grew throughout the 18th century and into the 19th century it influenced the descriptive abilities of many european novelists notably balzac and portrait artists such as joseph ducreux  meanwhile the norwich connection to physiognomy developed in the writings of amelia opie and travelling linguist george borrow a host of other 19th century english authors were influenced by the idea notably evident in the detailed physiognomic descriptions of characters in the novels of charles dickens thomas hardy and charlotte brontë
physiognomy is a central implicit assumption underlying the plot of oscar wilde the picture of dorian gray in 19th century american literature physiognomy figures prominently in the short stories of edgar allan poe7
phrenology was also considered a form of physiognomy it was created around 1800 by german physician franz joseph gall and johann spurzheim and was widely popular in the 19th century in europe and the united states in the us physician james w redfield published his comparative physiognomy in 1852 illustrating with 330 engravings the resemblances between men and animals he finds these in appearance and often metaphorically character eg germans to lions negroes to elephants and fishes chinamen to hogs yankees to bears jews to goats8
during the late 19th century english psychometrician sir francis galton attempted to define physiognomic characteristics of health disease beauty and criminality via a method of composite photography9 10 galton process involved the photographic superimposition of two or more faces by multiple exposures after averaging together photographs of violent criminals he found that the composite appeared more respectable than any of the faces comprising it  this was likely due to the irregularities of the skin across the constituent images being averaged out in the final blend with the advent of computer technology during the early 1990s galton composite technique has been adopted and greatly improved using computer graphics software 11
a physiognomist named yoshito mizuno was employed from 1936 to 1945 by the imperial japanese naval aeronautics department examining candidates for the naval air corps after   to their surprise   admiral yamamoto staff discovered that he could predict with over 80% accuracy the qualifications of candidates to become successful pilots12
practitioners of the personality type theory socionics use physiognomy as a personality identification technique1314 noted teacher and trainer hc linguere is known to say physiognomics provides a great tactical advantage in achieving objectives the body never lies15
a february 2009 article in the new scientist reported that the field is undergoing something of a revival researchers around the world are re evaluating what we see in a face investigating whether it can give us a glimpse of someone personality or even help to shape their destiny what is emerging is a new physiognomy which is more subtle but no less fascinating than its old incarnation16 in a study by tufts university published on january 18 2010 it was discovered that students could classify with great accuracy photos of real people according to the subject political orientation though the precise causality of the phenomenon remains unclear17

satire is primarily a literary genre or form although in practice it can also be found in the graphic and performing arts in satire vices follies abuses and shortcomings are held up to ridicule ideally with the intent of shaming individuals and society itself into improvement1 although satire is usually meant to be funny its greater purpose is often constructive social criticism using wit as a weapon
a common feature of satire is strong irony or sarcasm in satire irony is militant2 but parody burlesque exaggeration juxtaposition comparison analogy and double entendre are all frequently used in satirical speech and writing this militant irony or sarcasm often professes to approve or at least accept as natural the very things the satirist wishes to attack
satire is nowadays found in many artistic forms of expression including literature plays commentary and media such as lyrics
term

the word satire comes from the latin word satur and the subsequent phrase lanx satura satur meant full but the juxtaposition with lanx shifted the meaning to miscellany or medley the expression lanx satura literally means a full dish of various kinds of fruits3
the word satura as used by quintilian however indicated a narrower genre than what would be later intended as satire  it denoted only works in strictly hexameter form which were a distinctly roman genre3 quintilian famously said that satura that is a satire in hexameter verses was a literary genre of wholly roman origin satura tota nostra est he was aware of and commented on greek satire but at the time did not label it as such although today the origin of satire is considered to be aristophanes old comedy the first critic to use satire in the modern broader sense was apuleius3
the derivation of satire from satura properly has nothing to do with the greek mythological figure satyr4 to quintilian the satire was a strict literary form but the term soon escaped from the original narrow definition robert elliott writes
as soon as a noun enters the domain of metaphor as one modern scholar has pointed out it clamours for extension  and satura which had had no verbal adverbial or adjectival forms was immediately broadened by appropriation from the greek word for satyr satyros and its derivatives the odd result is that the english satire comes from the latin satura  but satirize satiric etc are of greek origin by about the 4th century ad the writer of satires came to be known as satyricus  st jerome for example was called by one of his enemies a satirist in prose atyricus scriptor in prosa subsequent orthographic modifications obscured the latin origin of the word satire satura becomes satyra and in england by the 16th century it was written atyre5
satire and humour

satirical works often contain straight humour usually to give relief from what might otherwise be relentless preaching although this has always been so it is probably more marked in modern satire yet some satire is not funny nor is meant to be obviously not all humour   even on such topics as politics religion or art or using the great satirical tools of irony parody and burlesque   is necessarily satirical  the most light hearted satire always has a serious after taste the ig nobel prize satire on trivial scientific research describes this as first make people laugh and then make them think   a fair definition of satire itself
the italian satirical playwright dario fo points out the difference between satire and good humoured teasing or sfottò which is an ancient form of buffoonery according to fo satire has a subversive character  it is directed against oppression and has a moral dimension on the other hand sfottò simple poking fun benign spoof light parodying and mockery is a form of comedy without satire subversive edge historically people in positions of power have tried to censor and repress satire but have often welcomed good humoured buffoonery67 from this fo draws criteria to tell real satire from sfottò saying that one can tell real satire from the reaction it arouses in the powerful8 sfottò on a powerful individual by focusing on superficial matters such as personal appearance may actually draw sympathy towards its target 9 hermann göring propagated jests and jokes against himself with the aim of humanizing his image1011
